| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Features

### Smart Contract Security

#### 1. Reentrancy Protection
- **Implementation**: OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`
- **Coverage**: All external functions that modify state
- **Protection**: Prevents reentrancy attacks during state changes

```solidity
function addLiquidity(uint256 amount, uint256 fixedAPY, bytes calldata metadata) 
    external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    // Function implementation
}
```

#### 2. Access Control
- **Implementation**: OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` pattern
- **Coverage**: Critical administrative functions
- **Protection**: Only contract owner can modify critical parameters

```solidity
function updateProtocolFees(uint256 _rootstockBridgeFee) external onlyOwner {
    protocolFees.rootstockBridgeFee = _rootstockBridgeFee;
}
```

#### 3. Input Validation
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive parameter validation
- **Coverage**: All external functions
- **Protection**: Prevents invalid inputs and edge cases

```solidity
require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
require(fixedAPY >= minAllowedAPY && fixedAPY <= maxAllowedAPY, "APY out of range");
```

#### 4. Overflow Protection
- **Implementation**: Solidity 0.8.19 built-in overflow protection
- **Coverage**: All arithmetic operations
- **Protection**: Prevents integer overflow/underflow attacks

#### 5. Pausable Functionality
- **Implementation**: OpenZeppelin's `Pausable`
- **Coverage**: All critical functions
- **Protection**: Emergency stop mechanism

```solidity
function pause() external onlyOwner {
    _pause();
}
```

### Collateral Security

#### 1. Over-Collateralization
- **Ratio**: 150% collateral requirement
- **Protection**: Ensures lenders are always protected
- **Calculation**: `requiredCollateral = (amount * 15000) / 10000`

#### 2. Collateral Validation
- **Implementation**: Real-time collateral value checking
- **Coverage**: All loan requests
- **Protection**: Prevents under-collateralized loans

### Frontend Security

#### 1. Input Sanitization
- **Implementation**: Client-side validation
- **Coverage**: All user inputs
- **Protection**: Prevents malicious input injection

#### 2. Transaction Confirmation
- **Implementation**: User confirmation for all transactions
- **Coverage**: All blockchain interactions
- **Protection**: Prevents unauthorized transactions

#### 3. Error Handling
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive error handling
- **Coverage**: All user interactions
- **Protection**: Prevents application crashes and data loss
