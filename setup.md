# 🚀 Quick Setup Guide

## ✅ Dependencies Installed Successfully!

Your lending protocol is now ready to run. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Demo Mode (Recommended for Quick Demo)

1. **Open your browser** and go to: **http://localhost:3000/demo**
2. **Explore the features**:
   - Pool Status: See live pool statistics
   - Lend: Add liquidity with custom APY
   - Borrow: Request loans (small vs whale logic)
   - Orderbook: Live matching simulation

## Option 2: Full Mode with Smart Contracts

1. **Deploy contracts** (in a new terminal):
```bash
cd /Users/rudrabhaskar/Desktop/ETHGlobal
npx hardhat node
```

2. **In another terminal, deploy contracts**:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

3. **Update environment variables** in `.env.local`:
```bash
# Copy the contract addresses from deployment output
NEXT_PUBLIC_LENDING_POOL_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_PYTH_ORACLE_ADDRESS=0x...
```

4. **Connect wallet** and use the full protocol at: **http://localhost:3000**

## 🎯 Key Features to Demo

### Small Borrower Protection
- Request loans < 1,000 USDC
- See how they get matched with lowest APY first
- Protected from whale impact

### Whale Borrower Logic  
- Request loans ≥ 1,000 USDC
- See how they get matched with highest APY first
- Pay weighted average APY

### Orderbook Simulation
- Watch the live matching process
- See how different borrower types are handled
- Understand the weighted APY calculation

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Port already in use**: Change the port in `package.json`:
```json
"dev": "next dev -p 3001"
```

2. **Wallet connection issues**: Use the demo mode first

3. **Contract deployment fails**: Check that Hardhat node is running
